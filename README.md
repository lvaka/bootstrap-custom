# boostrap-custom
This is my custom config for Bootstrap.  I mainly use the sizing and grid of Bootstrap, so I stripped away the features I use the least or not at all.  Most things like Modals I'm building my own based on the requirements of the project I'm working on.

I included my own Bootstrap breakpoint mixins for when I need to create my own classes and want them to change depending on my breakpoints.
